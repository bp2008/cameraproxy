User Setup

Users are defined each in their own file in the "Users" 
subdirectory.  The file name is the user name.  The first 
line of the file is the user name again.  The second line 
of the file is the password.

See the included example for specific usage details.

Note that any user can access any private camera, and no 
login is required to access a public camera.  The default 
login page sets a 1-year expiration cookie when you log 
in, so do not log in from public computers unless you are 
sure to clear the cookie before you leave.
