Html Setup

If you like, you can add custom html files to the "Html" 
subdirectory.  These files are regular Html files with the 
sole exception that the first line must be a 0 or a 1 to 
indicate public or private, respectively.

A private html page will require authentication before 
it can be loaded.

Html pages are served at the application root, so to 
access the included example "all.html", you would go to:

http://localhost:8077/all.html
